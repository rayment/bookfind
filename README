bookfind - Find books at the best price

---------------------------------------------------

bookfind is a simple Python script that naively scrapes the results from queries
to bookfinder.com for the best book prices either new or used, when provided
with a valid SBN, ISBN-10 or ISBN-13 number.

Keep in mind that this script is limited to the database provided by
bookfinder.com and thus there are possibly many entries that do not exist or are
not accurate.

bookfinder.com provides their service free of charge, so please be appreciative
and do not spam this script.

Note: You will need Python 3 to run this. No additional libraries other than
the built-in urllib and html.parser are required.
